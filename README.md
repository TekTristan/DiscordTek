# Discord Music Bot
This is a Discord bot that can play music from links, use Google API to perform search queries, and use text-to-speech to convert text into voice messages.

# Features
Play music from links: The bot can play music from YouTube, SoundCloud, and other music streaming platforms by providing a link to a specific song or playlist.

Google API integration: The bot can use the Google API to perform search queries and retrieve information from the web.

Text-to-speech: The bot can convert text into voice messages, allowing users to have the bot speak in the voice channel.
